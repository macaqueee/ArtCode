// Lifecycle:

JAR: - archive of my Classes
-classpath: place, where my .jar and .class (and etc.) presents
-classloader: loading class, what i need. (Classpath -> where from, import <package> -> what is loading)
 static fields and blocks -> calling during loading
 initializating of static: Only once, after first time loading Class (calling Class'es static variable or block from method)
 static depends on CLASS
 non-static depends on INSTANCE
 
 // final need to be initialized
 final reference
